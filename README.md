# Wave Guru

Android and IOS app that connects with WindGuru API to fetch data. I presented and offered the app as an open source project to Windguru owner but he is not interested to mantain and develop a Mobile App as WindGuru uses Progressive Web App.
The app has been deployed though EAS for internal distribution and server is hosted in Render.com.
